## Getting Started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lh3/minibwa
cd minibwa
make        # Or "make omp=0" if the compiler doesn't support OpenMP
./minibwa index test/chrM-human.fa.gz chrM-human              # index the genome
./minibwa map -a chrM-human test/chrM-read_?.fa.gz > aln.sam  # align and output in SAM

# other examples without test data
minibwa map -a -5P ref.index reads.interleaved.fq > aln.sam   # align Hi-C short reads
minibwa map -t16 ref.index long-read.fq > aln.paf             # align long reads
```

## Introduction

Minibwa aligns short reads against a reference genome. It is the successor of
bwa-mem with a different algorithm. Minibwa is 3-4 times as fast as the
original bwa-mem and twice as fast as bwa-mem2 at comparable accuracy. While
minibwa works with accurate long reads, minimap2 is more robust under high
error rate.

Minibwa is named after bwa-mem and minimap2 and is based on the source code of
both projects: it indexes the genome with Burrow-Wheeler Transform (BWT), finds
variable-length seeds as nested SuperMaximal Exact Matches (SMEMs) like
bwa-mem, and performs chaining and SIMD-based nucleotide alignment with the
minimap2 algorithm. Minibwa speeds up bwa-mem2 further with effective prefetch
for seeding, additional heuristics to skip unnecessary mate rescue and reduced
effort in highly repetitive regions where reads would often be wrongly mapped
anyway.
